/*
 * The purpose of this test is to demonstrate that
 * an attempt to join by a process with no children
 * or no unjoined children returns -2.
 *
 * Expected output:
 * testcase_main(): started
 * testcase_main(): after fork of child 3
 * testcase_main(): after fork of child 4
 * testcase_main(): performing first join
 * XXp1(): started
 * XXp1(): arg = 'XXp1'
 * XXp1(): performing join with no children
 * XXp1(): value returned by join is -2 expected value was -2
 * testcase_main(): exit status for child 3 is -1
 * testcase_main(): performing second join
 * XXp2(): started
 * XXp2(): arg = 'XXp2'
 * testcase_main(): exit status for child 4 is -2
 * testcase_main(): performing third join, have no unjoined children
 * testcase_main(): value returned by join is -2 expected value was -2
