testcase_main(): started
QUICK SUMMARY: Checking to see what happens when you call join() with no children at all.
XXp1(): started
XXp1(): arg = 'XXp1'
XXp1(): performing join with no children
XXp1(): value returned by join is -2 expected value was -2
testcase_main(): after fork of child 4
XXp2(): started
XXp2(): arg = 'XXp2'
testcase_main(): after fork of child 5
testcase_main(): performing first join
testcase_main(): exit status for child 5 is 2
testcase_main(): performing second join
testcase_main(): exit status for child 4 is 1
testcase_main(): performing third join, have no unjoined children
testcase_main(): value returned by join is -2 expected value was -2
