EXPECTATION: XXp1 should run promptly, as it is high priority; XXp2 should run only *after* we have started the second join(), because it is low priority.
XXp1(): started
XXp1(): arg = 'XXp1'
testcase_main(): after fork of child 4 -- you should not see this until XXp1 has completed.
testcase_main(): after fork of child 5 -- you should see this before XXp2 runs.
testcase_main(): performing first join
testcase_main(): exit status for child 4 is 3
testcase_main(): performing second join -- you should see this before XXp2 runs.
XXp2(): started
XXp2(): arg = 'XXp2'
testcase_main(): exit status for child 5 is 5
