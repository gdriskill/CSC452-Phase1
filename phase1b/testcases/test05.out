EXPECTATION: Create XXp1, which will create its own child, XXp2.  Each parent will join() with its child.  And the children will always be higher priority than the parent (in this testcase).
XXp1(): started
XXp1(): arg = 'XXp1'
XXp2(): started
XXp2(): arg = 'XXp2'
XXp1(): after fork of child 5
XXp1(): exit status for child 5 is 5
testcase_main(): after fork of child 4
testcase_main(): exit status for child 4 is 3
