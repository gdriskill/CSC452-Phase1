testcase_main(): started
EXPECTATION: testcase_main() will create 3 children, all running XXp1().  They have priority 5, so that they will not interrupt testcase_main().  The PID of each child is stored into a global array.  Then testcase_main() blocks in join() (three times).  The child processes should run in the same order they were created (we use a FIFO for ordering dispatch), and so each can call getpid() to confirm that it has the same value as stored in the global array.
testcase_main(): pidlist[] = [4,5,6, ...]
One of the XXp1() process has started, getpid()=4
This process's getpid() matched what fork1() returned.
This XXp1() process will now terminate.
One of the XXp1() process has started, getpid()=5
This process's getpid() matched what fork1() returned.
This XXp1() process will now terminate.
One of the XXp1() process has started, getpid()=6
This process's getpid() matched what fork1() returned.
This XXp1() process will now terminate.
testcase_main: joined with child 6
testcase_main: joined with child 5
testcase_main: joined with child 4
TESTCASE ENDED: Call counts:   check_io() 0   clockHandler() 0
